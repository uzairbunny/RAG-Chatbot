# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?

RAG is a technique that combines information retrieval with text generation. It works by:
1. Retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge base
2. Using those documents as context for a large language model
3. Generating accurate, contextual responses based on the retrieved information

## How does the RAG chatbot work?

Our RAG chatbot follows this process:
1. **Document Ingestion**: Upload documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.) to build a knowledge base
2. **Vector Storage**: Documents are chunked and converted to embeddings, stored in a vector database
3. **Query Processing**: When you ask a question, it's converted to an embedding
4. **Similarity Search**: The system finds the most relevant document chunks
5. **Response Generation**: An LLM generates an answer using the relevant context

## What file types are supported?

The chatbot supports:
- PDF files (.pdf)
- Word documents (.docx)
- Plain text files (.txt)
- Markdown files (.md)
- HTML files (.html)
- Web content via URLs

## How accurate are the responses?

Response accuracy depends on:
- Quality of the uploaded documents
- Relevance of the documents to your question
- Confidence scores provided with each response
- The LLM model being used (default: GPT-3.5-turbo)

## Can I use different vector databases?

Yes! The system supports:
- **FAISS**: Local vector database, good for development
- **Pinecone**: Cloud-based, scalable vector database
- **ChromaDB**: Local persistent vector database

Configure your preferred option in the `.env` file.

## How does conversation context work?

The chatbot maintains conversation history:
- Remembers previous questions and answers in the same conversation
- Provides context-aware follow-up responses
- Each channel (web, Slack, WhatsApp) maintains separate conversation threads

## Is my data secure?

Data security features:
- Documents are processed locally (unless using cloud vector databases)
- Conversation history is stored in memory by default
- API keys and sensitive configuration stored in environment variables
- You control where your data is stored and processed

## How do I integrate with Slack?

To integrate with Slack:
1. Create a Slack app at api.slack.com
2. Add bot token and signing secret to `.env`
3. Configure event subscriptions and slash commands
4. Set webhook URLs to point to your chatbot server

## How do I integrate with WhatsApp?

For WhatsApp integration:
1. Set up a Twilio account
2. Configure WhatsApp sandbox or business account
3. Add Twilio credentials to `.env`
4. Set webhook URL in Twilio console

## Can I customize the responses?

Yes, you can customize:
- The system prompt in the RAG system
- Number of retrieved documents (top_k)
- Chunk size and overlap for document processing
- LLM model and parameters
- Response formatting for different channels

## What are the system requirements?

Minimum requirements:
- Python 3.8+
- 4GB RAM (8GB+ recommended)
- 2GB disk space for dependencies
- OpenAI API key
- Optional: Pinecone/Slack/Twilio accounts for additional features

## How do I monitor performance?

The system provides:
- Confidence scores for each response
- Source attribution showing which documents were used
- API endpoints for health checks and statistics
- Conversation history and analytics
